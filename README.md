# Python
Everything interesting that have done in Python. Python is my programming language of choice, so any idea for a game or if I find something interesting in mathematics that I want to code, I do in Python.

## Math

* Linear Algebra (see README in that directory for more details)
* Prime checker and Prime list generator
* Fibonacci sequence generator
* GCD calculator
* Convert a number in base 10 to binary
* Using the "repeated squares" method to calculate the a^b (mod n) of large numebrs
* Checking if a number is a perfect square without a sqrt function

## Sorting
I have code many sorting algorithms in C, which are avaiable in the repository labeled C. Using NumPy and MatPlotLib, I have animated a subset of these sorting algorithms. I have animated

* [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/ekeilty17/Python/tree/master/Sorting/Bubblesort)
* [Cocktail Sort](https://github.com/ekeilty17/Python/tree/master/Sorting/Cocktailsort)
* [Insertion Sort](https://github.com/ekeilty17/Python/tree/master/Sorting/Insertionsort)
* [Selection Sort](https://github.com/ekeilty17/Python/tree/master/Sorting/Selectionsort)
* [Slow Sort](https://github.com/ekeilty17/Python/tree/master/Sorting/Slowsort)
* [Merge Sort](https://github.com/ekeilty17/Python/tree/master/Sorting/Mergesort)
* [Heap Sort](https://github.com/ekeilty17/Python/tree/master/Sorting/Heapsort)
* [Quick Sort](https://github.com/ekeilty17/Python/tree/master/Sorting/Quicksort)
* [Radix Sort](https://github.com/ekeilty17/Python/tree/master/Sorting/Radixsort)

## TSP
TSP stands for "Traveling Salesman Problem". It is a famous problem in graph theory, which asks how to efficiently find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. In this directory I have included my implementation of a graph in Python as well as the following solutions to the TSP

* Nearest Neighbor
* Dijkstra

## Games
Games are always fun things to code in your free time. I have coded the following games.

* [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/ekeilty17/Python/tree/master/Games/TicTacToe)
* [Chess](https://github.com/ekeilty17/Python/tree/master/Games/Chess)
* [Knight's Tour]()
* [Sudoku](https://github.com/ekeilty17/Python/tree/master/Games/Sudoku)
* [Flood](https://github.com/ekeilty17/Python/tree/master/Games/Flood)
* [Poker](https://github.com/ekeilty17/Python/tree/master/Games/Poker)
* [Reversi](https://github.com/ekeilty17/Python/tree/master/Games/Reversi)

## Turtle
Turtle is a crude drawing tool in Python. I have coded a few things using it just for fun. I enjoy the intellectual excercise of figuring out the geometry to make everything connect. There is not much useful about any of this code however.

## Useful

### Syntax
There are many things that just require memorizing the syntax of the programming language in order to do.

* Reading files
* Writing files
* Getting arguments from the terminal
* Sorting a CSV file
* Parallel processing
* Timing code
* HTTP requests
* Writing to a mysql database

### Data Structures
I have implemented many data structures in C, which are available in the repository labeled C. I have coded a subset of them in python as well.

* Stack
* Queue
* Heap
* Graph
* General Tree
* Binary Tree
* **[General Search Tree](https://github.com/ekeilty17/Python/tree/master/Useful/Data_Structures/General%20Search%20Tree)**

### Miscellaneous

* Encryption
* Solution to Optimal Scheduling Problem

## One Liners File
Python has lambda notation for list generation, which can be very useful and the purpose is to make code more concise and readable. However, I think some people tend to over-use this notation in complicated ways sacraficing readability for brevity. I generally value readability of code, so I would never actually use these one-liners. However, I do enjoy the intellectual excercise of trying to figure out how to make them.
