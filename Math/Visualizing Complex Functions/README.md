# Visualizing Complex Functions

I was learning complex analysis and I was having a hard time visualizing plots of complex functions. All these different phenomena occur such as multi-functions, branch points, branch cuts, etc. This is an interactive tool that allows you to draw on the input plane and see the corresponding path in the output plane.

This requires python3, opencv-python, and numpy. Simply execute
`python3 graph.py`
